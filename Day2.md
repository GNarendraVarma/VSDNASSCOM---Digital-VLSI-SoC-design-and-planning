# THEORY:
Here we were taught how to make a good floorplan and also we were taught about the library cells.In this day the following concepts were being learnt, they are as follow:
- Utilisation Factor and Aspect Ratio : So, after we have created the RTL Netlist we would have that in the form of the gates and flipflops but in general during the floorplan each of the module that is the gates or flipflops or mux are taken as a block and they are represented as a block and are being placed on the chip. So, here in the floorplan we would calculate how much are from the core would be utilized by us to for the placement of all of all of the cells which are being present. So for this we calcualte the total area of the core avialable to us and the total area being utilised by all of the blocks which are being present for a given implementation that is the total area occupied by the netlist. Usually the Utilization factor is kep at 50%.
  
- Utilization Factor = Area taken by the netlist/Total area of the Core
  
- Aspect Ratio: The Aspect ratio is nothing but the ratio of the Height to Width
- Aspect Ratio = Height/Width

- Then we were being introducted to the concept of the Pre-Placed Cells. The Pre-Placed cells are the logic blocks that are being frequently being reused in our given chip or whole process. So, the pre-placed cells will be given to those logical blocks which would be accessed on a regular basis on at different times so instead of taking the multiple copies of them as wasting the space on the core we would keep the location of the Pre-placed cells on our chip so that when ever they are need they would be acting from the same spot instead of creating the multiple components of them and the location allocated for the pre-placed cells cannot be taken by any other logical block in our chip. These pre placed cells are sually the memory, clock gating cells, comparator, MUX or etc. Then on the basis of this pre-placed cells we would keep the othere components on our chip and this planning is called as the floorplanning where we would just make a plan on where to keep which logical block.

- Then we were being taught about the decoupling capactiors and their importance. The decoupling capacitors are the capacitors which would help in providing the proper power supply to our circuit and let it always be in the acceptable noise margin range. These capacitors are being mainly used because here we can see that even if we give the proper vdd from the source we wont get the complete vdd at the logic because of the parasitic properties or wires, resistors, capactiors and inductors being present on the way so there is a chance that at times the input power would be so less that i would be out of the noise margin range causing the error to happen and making to circuit to go into an unstable state so to avoid this only we are going to use the decoupling capactiors and these even help in maintaining the stability in the input power given to it.

- Power Planning : The power planning is another important concept which has been taught to us over here that is when we usually discharge or charge a less number of the cells or the logical cells we see that that is no much difference but when we are using aonly a single power supply for many number of logical cells or circuits and they try to discharge or charge at a time we see that these is small outward bump on the ground line and the small inward bump on the vdd line which is an area of concern, this is because if this bump is large and crosses the noise margin then it may go to an unstable state so in order to resolve thiss issue we would do power planning where we would give multiple power and the ground lines and the components are being placed on them according to requirement so that the above case doesn't occur again.

- Repeaters: Repeters are another main one which is being used in our chip. We see that the different components are being placed at different location of the logic so that they are being present near the proper input or the output pins and can have the input easily but here there is a small thing that is if the distance among them is too far we can see that there is some signal loss going to occur and the exact information is not being transferred so we are going to use the repeaters over here among the different netlist blocks so that the information is not being lost during the transmission. But the only issues is that we would be reducing the utilization factor as we are introducing more number of block on the core of our chip.

- Cell Design and Characteristion flow: Here we were being told about the CEll design flow which has three parts, they are the inputs, design steps and the outputs. In the inputs we would have the Process Design Kits, DRC, LSV rules and the spice models libraly along with the user specfication then in the design steps we would use the above inputs to make the circuit design, the layout design and give them the characterization according to our requirement. So finally we would be getting the CDL file, the LEF, spice netlist, Timing, noise, power library and functions.

- In characterization flow we would first read the SPICE model files which have the device parameters, then import the etlist which we have extracted from the spice simulators, identify the buffer behaviour and understand their drive strength and signal propagation, then parsing the subcircuits as defined in our spice heirarchu, then give the powre supplies along with the ground to our circuit then apply the input stimuls to stimulate the switching, add appropriate output load capacitance and finally dfine the simulation control command
