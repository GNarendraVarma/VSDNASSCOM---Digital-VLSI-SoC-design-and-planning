# VSDNASSCOM---Digital-VLSI-SoC-design-and-planning
This repository documents a 5-day hands-on workshop on Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning conducted by VSD Corp using open-source tools and the Google SkyWater 130nm PDK. The goal is to go from RTL to GDSII using tools like OpenLANE, Magic, Ngspice, and TritonRoute.
The Screenschot of all the lab being done is in the branch named master so you can go there and find them
